Operating System: MAC OS

First compile the pic library(make sure it locates one level above)

Instructions for complie and run
	Use the provided Makefile, type "make". It will be complied.
	Run the program: type "./assign2 track.txt".


Take Screenshot:
	Type "X" or "x" in keyboard, all screenshot will be saved to folder named "imageOutput"
	(I have taken the screen shots)

Requirements:
	Level one: create 3 sets of Catmull-Rom spline points, two for double rail and 1 for camera movement. 
	Level two: Map the ground by an earth image
	Level three: Map the sky by galaxy images. Create a space roller coaster
	Level four: Move the camera along the spline points
	Level five: Create wood textured cross bars.


Extra Credits:
	1. Render a T-shaped rail cross-section. 
	   Create the rectanger section between two rails.

	2. Render double rail (like in real railroad tracks).
	   create 3 sets of Catmull-Rom spline points, two for double rail and 1 for camera 

	3. Make your track circular and close it with C1 continuity (small credit, i.e., 1 point).
	   The track is circular by reset the camera in the end. It will not stop.

	4. Draw additional scene elements: 
	   texture-mapped wooden crossbars

	5. Modify the velocity with which your camera moves to make it physically realistic in terms of gravity: 
	   Use the formula provided here.
